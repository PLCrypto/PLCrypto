### Hi there

All ACD files in the source codes folder require a special vendor software (Studio 5000) to open. To facilitate readers who have no access to Studio 5000, we provide the text version of the source codes in the "txt code" subfolder. Notice that tag declarations and PLC system settings are only visible in the ACD files. Detailed settings can be seen in the paper.

For more information, please see our paper: "PLCrypto: A Symmetric Cryptographic Library for Programmable Logic Controllers", Z. Yang, Z. Bao, C. Jin, Z. Liu, and J. Zhou. (2021) In IACR Transactions on Symmetric Cryptology.

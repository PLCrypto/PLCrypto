This folder provides the complete implementation of PLCrypto written in Structured Texts in txt file format. 

Note 1: These files are provided for demonstration purposes only. They cannot be directly executed on your PLCs. Please copy the codes into your ST programming environment and compile them. 

Note 2: All the tag (variable) declarations are not done in ST code. They have to be declared using the GUI of the programming environment (e.g., Studio 5000 in our test environment). In each folder, there is a "*tag.txt" file, which shows the variables declared and their corresponding data types. Please follow the "*tag.txt" file and declare the tags in your own programming environment.

Note 3: There are some system-level settings needed to guarantee the security of PLCrypto. Please refer to our paper "PLCrypto: A Symmetric Cryptographic Library for Programmable Logic Controllers". It is highly recommended to check out the ACD files we provided as a reference if you can open them.
